- need to import packages (like beautiful soup) each time you start a new file or a new command line window.
but only install once
- pip install is from REGULAR command line. import is in Python command line.
- need to use PyQt in order to get dynamic JavaScript data. Python and BeautifulSoup will not automatically get it
- run python files from the regular command line, not python!
- sys.exit(app.exec_()) creates a loop to stop the program from ending until the user quits out of it
- benefits and drawbacks of "import ___", "from ____ import ____", and "from ____ import *""
- basic "import ___" means you need the context every time you call a method. "PyQt5.Qt" NOT just "QT"
- PyQt is for GUIs
- in "QPushButton("&Quit");", the ampersand indicates that "Q" (or whichever letter follows the ampersand) is a hotkey to trigger the corresponding action.
        - But also need another line to actually set the shortcut so not sure what this is useful for?
- "with" statement simplifies file streams / file access operations
- Tuple is an ordered, immutable set of values, often separated by commas and no brackets.
        - in "name, __ = function()" name, __ is a tuple?
- Main menu / menuBar is the actual bar. You then add different menus to it. Each menu is a word you see on the bar. Like "File". These menus can then have different options once you click into them.
- Create layout in QtDesigner. Then create a new .py file to import the .ui code and add functionality to the layout.
- To interact with the layout, reference the names of items as given in QtDesigner or the .ui file (for example, if the pushbutton is named "tom", you use the word "tom" to make stuff happen when a user clicks on the pushbutton)
